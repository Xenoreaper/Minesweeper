# Minesweeper
This is my version of the classic game Minesweeper, available in probably all modern browsers, tested for Google Chrome as instructed in the lecture.<br>
It uses cookies to store the current game. Cookies are only saved for the current session, closing the browser deletes all cookies used by the game.<br>
The three buttons can be used to generate different size minefields.<br>
In this version of Minesweeper, I replaced the flag with a rat. He's our little mine-sniffing rat.

## Functionality
<kbd>Left Mouse Button</kbd> to uncover the clicked tile<br>
<kbd>Right Mouse Button</kbd> to mark or unmark the clicked tile<br>
<kbd>Double Click</kbd> to uncover all tiles around the clicked one, this requires enough rats around the number tile

## Known Issues
- On Firefox the tiles overflow from the playfield, this seems to be some kind of rounding/calculation error. (If anyone sees this project and knows a solution please contect me)
